branched anchoring cells to the cuticle of free-living nematodes,
Panagrellus dubius. Panagrellus nematodes are known as the “sour
paste” nematodes because they typically inhabit environments
undergoing fermentative changes (Hechler 1971), including insect
frass and slime flux. All strains of this species were isolated from galleries
of the poplar borer (Saperda calcarata, Coleoptera:
Cerambycidae), a wood-boring beetle in trembling aspen (Populus
tremuloides) trees. The nematodes are presumably vectored by the
beetles. Small wounds are created when the adult female chews a
slit in the bark, in which she typically deposits one egg, sometimes
two. The egg hatches into a larva that mines the wood, creating a
network of galleries. The galleries are moist and lined with yeasts,
bacteria, and filamentous fungi, creating a suitable habitat for
Panagrellus nematodes and Ascobotryozyma species. As larvae mine
into the wood, much of the boring dust, or frass, is expelled through
the opening in the bark where the egg was laid (Baker 1972, Metcalf
and Flint 1939). Other insects are attracted to the entrance sites
because of their fermentative smell, and these insects may also vector

The nematode and yeast were isolated from Populus (aspen and cottonwood) trees, from galleries created by the poplar borer, Saperda calcarata (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a long-horned, wood-boring beetle whose larvae carve out galleries for two or more years (Metcalf and Flint 1939). Isolates from willow (Salix sp.) were infested by the poplar and willow borer (Cryptorhynchus lapathi, Coleoptera: Curculionidae), an exotic, ubiquitous beetle commonly found in shrubby willows (Smith and Stott 1964). The P. dubius nematode species was first described from the frass of Cryptorhynchus lapathi galleries (Sanwal 1960). The nematodes and Ascobotryozyma are presumably vectored by the beetles and are introduced into the wood when the eggs are laid in the bark. Larvae mine into the wood and create galleries, which serve as a suitable habitat for Panagrellus nematodes and Ascobotryozyma species. As the larvae mine, boring dust, called frass, is expelled through the opening in the bark where the egg was laid. This opening, or entrance site, grows larger as the larvae mature, and more and more frass is pushed out. The galleries stay moist and are lined with microorganisms, creating a fermentative
smell that attracts other insects. These other insects may also serve as vectors of the nematodes and Ascobotryozyma.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

more frequently than originally thought and the apparent rarity
derived from the difficulty of correct identification by the physiological

Pyralidae). Some strains (received from C.A. Rosa) were recovered
from feeding sites of the moth Sigelgaita (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) sp.
in Pilosocereus arrabidae (Cactaceae) in Brazil. Strain UWOPS85-351.1
is from the exudate of an oak (Quercus emoryi (Fagaceae) growing in
the vicinity of cacti in Arizona, USA.
Complementary mating types: CBS 7068, mating type h1 and CBS
7069, mating type h2.","Although C. opuntiae occurs in decaying cactus fruit as well
as somatic tissue, the host specificity is remarkable, in view of the
worldwide distribution of the species. C. opuntiae, which is found in
10% of all prickly pear samples ever collected (Lachance et al. 1988b),
accounts for 5% of the yeasts isolated from prickly pears and 2% or
less of isolates from other cactus species (Starmer et al. 1990). Many
vectors (e.g., Drosophila spp.) are likely to contribute significantly
to the yeast's distribution, but the prickly pear moth, Cactoblastis
cactorum, is thought to play a major role in confining C. opuntiae
mostly to Opuntia spp., as the occurrence of the moth coincides to
some extent with the abundance of the yeast (Starmer et al. 1988a).
DNA fingerprinting (Lachance 1990a) and sequencing studies
(Lachance et al. 2000c) indicated that cacti may bear, in their
C. opuntiae biota, a genetically diverse resident component, and
additionally, a more homogeneous population associated with
C. cactorum. Rosa et al. (1992), working in the region of Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil, found C. opuntiae less frequently in Opuntia species than in the columnar cactus Pilosocereus arrabidae, where the yeast
appears to exist in association with the moth Sigelgaita sp.
Considerable inequalities have been observed in the distribution
of mating types within local populations. An h1:h2 ratio greater than
30:1 was observed among Australian isolates (Phaff et al. 1986), with
the nearly exact reverse in strains collected on the Bahamian Island of
Great Inagua (Lachance et al. 2000c). Brazilian isolates exhibited a
20:1 mating type ratio (Rosa et al. 1992). Even more extreme disparities
were found in the Hawaiian archipelago (Lachance et al. 2000c).
Specifically, 76 isolates collected on Maui Island all had mating type
h2. Some of these inequalities are attributed in part to the rapid
movement of bottlenecked populations of C. opuntiae, which is due to
the anthropogenic introduction of the moth Cactoblastis cactorum
used in the biological control of prickly pear cactus. Another factor
that may dampen the equalization of mating types in local population
is the fact that mating in C. opuntiae appears to require direct contact
between compatible cells, G1 arrest due to nitrogen starvation, and
fairly equal mixtures of the two mating types (Lachance et al. 1994).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

by Remak (1845), but he did not find the species in carnivores, birds
or reptiles. These observations were confirmed by Robin (1853).
Cells were observed by Cochet (1940) in rabbit, but not cultured,
and were also seen in low abundance in rat and cavia. The species is
prevalent and easily isolated from the alimentary tract and feces of
hay- or straw-fed rabbits, but not milk-fed rabbits (Rolle and
Mehnert 1957). Buecher and Phaff (1972) isolated an atypical dimorphic
filamentous strain of C. guttulatus from wild jack rabbit.
Shifrine and Phaff (1958) proposed that coprophagy of the soft night
feces, which have a higher viable yeast population, replenishes the
colonization of this species in the rabbit stomach. The necessity for
coprophagy to maintain the population in the rabbit stomach is not
supported by the high number of proliferating C. guttulatus cells
observed by Zierdt et al. (1988) in the mucus layer of the rabbit
stomach .
In a survey of the yeast flora of a variety of mammals, C. guttulatus
was found in the alimentary tract of all 30 rabbits examined, but
not in that of cows, pigs, opossums, sheep, monkeys, cats, dogs,
hedgehogs, mice, guinea pigs and rats (Parle 1957). However, cells
with the distinctive large-celled morphology of this species have
been observed associated with dogs (Houwers and Blankenstein
2001, Neel et al. 2006). Zierdt et al. (1988) observed numerous ascospores

interest. The species is recovered at a high frequency in Guanacaste
Province of Costa Rica, as well as Hawaiian lowlands (Lachance et al.
2003a). In continental populations, both mating types are found in
approximately equal numbers, but all Hawaiian isolates are of the
single mating type h2. This serves as evidence that the species was
introduced from the American mainland through the importation of
material that contained the beetle Conotelus mexicanus (Lachance
et al. 2001b), resulting in a founder effect. The beetle is known to
have invaded the Hawaiian archipelago in the middle of the 20th
Century (Nishida 1957). Populations of M. lochheadii from five
Hawaiian Islands were studied, together with several Costa Rican isolates,
by sequencing of the rDNA intergenic spacers and genotyping
of polymorphic DNA markers (Lachance et al. 2008b). The Hawaiian
isolates were practically identical, but differed from continental isolates
in many of the loci examined, adding more evidence in favor of
a single introduction.
The spatial distribution of M. lochheadii in relation to other
Metschnikowia species is also worthy of attention. In Costa Rica,
M. lochheadii is the only species found in Conotelus spp. in the
warmer, drier lowlands of Guanacaste (e.g., Santa Rosa National Park
and vicinity). In the cooler uplands, situated near the volcanic rainforests
of the Guanacaste Cordillera, the same habitat is shared with
several other species, including M. dekortorum, M. santaceciliae, and
at least four other relatives. A similar partitioning is seen in the
Hawaiian Islands. Samples taken in the warm lowlands of five islands
yielded almost exclusively M. lochheadii. Sympatry with M. hawaiiensis
was observed in Kipuka Puaulu, a cooler site located at a higher
elevation, where M. lochheadii may be acting as an invasive exotic on
its way to eliminating an endemic relative (Lachance et al. 2003a).
The habitat partitioning may be linked partly to differences in the
maximum growth temperatures of these species, and partly to insect
vector specificity. In Kipuka Puaulu, Hawai'i, M. lochheadii predominates
in the introduced beetle Conotelus mexicanus, whereas
M. hawaiiensis exhibits a closer association with the endemic beetle
Prosopeus subaeneus. M. lochheadii was also absent in various
Hawaiian endemic nitidulids that harbor other large-spored
Metschnikowia species, related to M. hawaiiensis and apparently
endemic to other parts of the archipelago (Lachance et al. 2005).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

gut of a particular species of lacewing, which suggests a strong symbiosis.
However, the nature of the association is not known. As indicated in
Fig. 46.24, culturing asci in the presence of the filamentous fungus
Cladosporium gossypiicola causes asci to appear thin-walled and to
release their ascospores terminally, presumably due to the action of lytic
hydrolases produced by this fungus (Nguyen et al. 2006). A similar apical
ascospore release was reported for M. bicuspidata by Lachance et al.
(1976), when the asci were observed in situ in infected brine shrimp. In
the presence of nematodes (Panagrellus sp.) and their endogenous bacteria,
mature asci of M. hawaiiensis disappeared completely, giving way to
abundant free ascospores (M.A. Lachance, unpublished data). Taken
together, these observations suggest that interactions between yeasts
and non-yeast species within a community may be integral to the
yeasts' life history. Analogous conclusions have been drawn recently on
the role of ascospores in the interaction between Saccharomyces and
Drosophila species (Coluccio et al. 2008, Reuter et al. 2007).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

organization, and the first sequenced eukaryotic genome, is rarely
isolated in natural environments. On the occasions in which it has
been isolated (Capriotti 1954, Parle and di Menna 1966, Redzepovic
et al. 2002, Sampaio and Gonçalves 2008, Sniegowski et al. 2002),
enrichment culture was routinely used favoring the growth of this
species, which has been shown to be present in extremely low numbers
with respect to the dominating microbiota (Davenport 1976,
Martini et al. 1996, Phaff et al. 1978a). On the contrary, S. cerevisiae
massively colonizes artificial fermentation environments where it
persists, reproduces, evolves and can be dispersed (Mercado et al.
2007, Rosini 1984).
This genetic isolation in technological islands (wineries, breweries,
bakeries) may have originated a kind of “winery drift” favoring
highly fermenting cells in sugar rich habitats. Accordingly, a selection
was imposed towards a catabolic pathway with low energy efficiency
and negligible respiration (Crabtree effect) (Merico et al. 2007).
These peculiar physiological characteristics could be the reason for
the scarce presence of this species in natural environments (Martini
et al. 1996, Phaff et al. 1978a) due to an inability to compete with
other microorganisms, which are more adapted to those habitats.
At this point, a scenario could be proposed in which a progenitor
strain/species associated with the few sugar-rich natural substrates
(e.g., tree exudates, fruits) was involved in the first episodes of natural
fermentation of sugary juices. It could be possible that through
time the process was recognized as useful, and the procedure was
continued and improved upon by humans. A suitable candidate for
this primeval starter/progenitor is S. paradoxus, which is still the only
highly fermenting Saccharomyces species isolated exclusively in
nature (Liti et al. 2006, Naumov and Nikonenko 1988). S. paradoxus
is for the most part phenotypically indistinguishable from S. cerevisiae
with which it shares about 50% of its nucleotide sequences
(Vaughan-Martini 1989) and which has been shown to mate with
the domesticated species, although generally without producing fertile
progeny (Naumov 1986b). It may be possible that sometime in
the past S. paradoxus occupied and persisted in man-made environments
(e.g., brewery/winery/bakery) and through genetic changes
evolved into S. cerevisiae (Vaughan-Martini and Martini 1995).
Fernandez-Espinar et al. (2003) discuss the feasibility of the two
conflicting hypotheses regarding the origin of S. cerevisiae: (a) a “natural”
yeast species of plant origin (Mortimer and Polsinelli 1999), or
(b) a domesticated species originating from the natural species
S. paradoxus (Martini and Vaughan-Martini 1990). While not
confirming either of the theories, results of a RAPD-PCR study
(Fernandez-Espinar et al. 2003) indicate: (1) a close relationship
between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus as also demonstrated by other
studies (Liti et al. 2006, Naumov 1986b, Vaughan-Martini 1989),
(2) that S. cerevisiae strains of different origin form a monophyletic
group with a single origin (compatible with both a natural speciation
process and a single domestication event), and (3) that S. paradoxus
shows a higher degree of genetic diversity with respect to
S. cerevisiae, indicating a more ancient origin of the former species,
which is compatible with its possible parental role in the origin of
S. cerevisiae as originally suggested by Vaughan-Martini and Martini
(1990).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cactaceae), e.g., UWOPS 87-2411.2, Hawai’i, USA; and from necrotic
somatic tissue of other cacti, e.g., UCD-FST 76-406C, Sonora, Mexico.","The strongest factor bearing on the distribution of phylotypes
(Fig. 69.1) in the S. cereana species complex appears to be
geography. The strains assigned to the “australis” group originated
from Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela. The “brasiliensis” phylotype is
so far confined to Brazil. Strains labeled “centralis” came from
Honduras and Mexico. The many confirmed members of S. cereana
in the narrowest sense are restricted to Arizona and Hawai’i where
they were ostensibly introduced together with cacti. The variant
of the species termed “oaxacaensis” consists of several strains collected
in southern Mexico. The phylotype “obscura” seems more
widespread, with isolates in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Venezuela.
Most strains designated as “opuntiana” were spread across the
Caribbean region, Florida and Texas (USA), Peru, and with occasional
isolates from Australia that were probably introduced. The phylotype
“pachycereana” is known from a single isolate collected in Baja
California, Mexico, and the designation “trichocereana” applies to two
strains recovered in large columnar cacti in Argentina. The eventual
discovery of additional biotypes cannot be discounted, as evidenced
from a preliminary analysis conducted on material obtained in other
Neotropical localities by P.F. Ganter (personal communication).
The absence of members of the S. cereana species complex in
cactus fruit samples has been attributed in part to the abundance in
cactus fruit of yeasts capable of producing killer toxins to which certain
strains of S. cereana are sensitive (Starmer et al. 1987). Moreover,
a negative correlation exists between the presence of S. cereana in
individual samples of prickly pear somatic tissue and the occurrence
in each sample of strong killer strains of Pichia kluyveri.
In a study of the diversity of soil fungi by whole community DNA
analysis, Anderson et al. (2003a) reported the presence of an ITS
sequence whose best match was with the “australis” phylotype. A
recent examination of the sequence in question (AY324163), however,
revealed that the highest sequence identity was with Nadsonia
species. The previous misidentification was in all probability due to
the small number of yeast ITS sequences deposited at the time that
the study was performed.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

isolated include honey, fruit juice and juice concentrates, grape must,
mayonnaise, salad dressing, sweet pickle, vinegar, wine and soft
drinks (Barnett et al. 2000a, Kurtzman 1990c, Thomas and Davenport
1985). Z. bailii is not part of the normal yeast flora of well-run food
factories, and where it does occur, the number of Z. bailii isolates in
the yeast population is usually small (Steels 2005). The natural habitat
of Z. bailii is most probably in dehydrated, “mummified” fruit
